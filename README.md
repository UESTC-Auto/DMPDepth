This repository hosts the dataset for the project paper:

**"Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Depth-Motion Prior for Intelligent Measurement"**

We are excited to share our work with the community and look forward to its positive impact on intelligent measurement research. Details regarding dataset access and usage will be updated following the paperâ€™s acceptance.

---

## Overview

The DMPDepth project introduces a self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation that leverages depth-motion priors. This approach is particularly effective for intelligent measurement tasks where accurate depth prediction is critical. The dataset contained in this repository was used for evaluating and validating our approach and will serve as an important resource for further research in this area.
